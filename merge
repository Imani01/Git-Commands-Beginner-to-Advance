merge - 
     so once development is complete and everything is working just fine. I know you expect me to tell you not to touch the code but guess yes I would tell you that but no.

Anyways the final step before deployment if it's an app or website this command helps you merge the branch you were working on with the parent branch(dev or master).

In order to merge you must be in the master then run the following command to merge the branch to the master.
# To return to the master branch first run 
     $ git checkout master
# Then to go to merge the branch to the master we run
     $ git merge branchname
