add - 
    Used to track your changes made in Git.

When we modify or delete a file, these changes only happen in our local machine and won't included in the next commit
(Of Course unless we change the configurtions). 

Using this command you can add a single change"$ git add script.js" this is where a new script.js has been added if multiple are added but not all commas are used to specify those files,
      or 
all =>"$ git add ."
