branch - 
      this command is used to checkout the current branch. Can be used to create a new branch once the name of the new branch is added at the end.
      
$ git branch statebranch.

# You can also delete the created branch using the following command.
$ git branch -d branchname  or $ git branch -D branchname

NOTE:
# I discourage the latter this is because any changes that have not been commited will be deleted but with the lowercase d it'll show you the changes made and not commited before deleting.

It allows you and me as developers to work parallel on the same project simultaneously.
   used for creating, listing and deleting branches.
